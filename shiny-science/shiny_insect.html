          or <em>insect anatomy</em>, which is <em>way</em> different! </p>

          <h1>The Insect Lifecycle</h1>
          <p>
            Some insects like the butterfly have a four stage lifecycle (called
            complete metamorphosis):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>egg</li>
            <li>larva</li>
            <li>pupa</li>
            <li>adult</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>
            Let’s talk about these stages using a butterfly as our example:
          </h2>
          <h3>The Egg Stage</h3>
          <p>
            Butterfly eggs are fixed to a leaf with a special glue which hardens
            rapidly. This is the same glue is made by the pupa to attach its
            chrysalis to some sort of plant. The egg stage normally only lasts a
            few weeks, although if they are laid close to winter, the eggs might
            rest until spring.
          </p>
          <img src="images/egg.jpg" alt="egg" />
          <h3>The Larva Stage</h3>
          <p>
            Butterfly larva are called caterpillars – they eat, and eat and EAT!
            They spend nearly all of their time either eating or looking for
            food! Caterpillars mature in a series of stages where they moult
            (shed their skin) as they get larger.
          </p>
          <img src="images/larva.jpg" alt="larva" />
          <h3>The Pupa Stage</h3>
          <p>
            When a larva is full grown it stops eating and begins wandering
            around looking for a good place to attach its chrysalis (usually the
            underside of a leaf).
          </p>
          <img src="images/pupa.jpg" alt="pupa" />
          <h3>The Adult Stage</h3>
          <p>
            After a few weeks (or in some cases months) an adult butterfly
            emerges from the chrysalis and hangs under its leaf. It then
            inflates its wings, and waits for them to dry and harden. The drying
            process can take from 1 to 3 hours.
          </p>
          <img src="images/adult.jpg" alt="adult" />
          <p>
            Butterfly wings are covered in scales. Most butterflies are very
            pretty to look at and they can be very colorful. Adult butterflies
            don’t consume solid food – they drink liquids like the nectar from
            flowers. They have long hollow tongues for that reason. Butterflies
            use their antennae to sense the air for wind and scents. They also
            see very well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some species of butterflies (like the monarch) live many months
            (nearly a year). They also migrate. Each year millions of Monarch
            butterflies travel from Canada and the USA down to Mexico.

              ANTS - can carry 5 to 20 times their body weight, and will work
              together in small or large groups to move heavier things. Ants can
              also use teamwork to create a ‘life raft’ to cross puddles, and
              even float down streams/rivers to find a new habitat.
